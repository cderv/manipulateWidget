# manipulateWidget 0.4 (2016-12-16)

## Breaking changes

* Function combineWidgets has been entirely rewritten and now produces a htmlwidget that can be included as is in documents or shiny applications. The general behavior is the same, but some parameters have changed

## New features

* `manipulateWidget()` can now update an already rendered widget instead of overwriting it each time the user changes an input. This leads to better performance and user experience. Look at the documentation of manipulateWidget for further information.

## Bug fixes
* `manipulateWidget()` now preserves the order of the initial value of select inputs.
* `manipulateWidget()` now automatically finds the correct render and output functions. This solves in particular sizing problems.

# manipulateWidget 0.3 (2016-10-06)

* add a file LICENSE and copyright to sources files

# manipulateWidget 0.2 (2016-09-27)

## New features

* New functions mwUI and mwControlsUI have been added to let the user easily reuse the user interface generated by the package but with different server logic.
* User can now easily create group of inputs in function manipulate widget. In the UI, these inputs are grouped in a panel that can be collapsed/opened by clicking on its name.

## Bug fixes

* Many useless but worrying warning messages have been removed.
